# Interactive Storytelling App

Welcome to the Interactive Storytelling App! This web application allows users to create and expand on stories interactively with the assistance of an AI. Users can input their story ideas, and the AI will help continue the story, creating a collaborative and creative writing experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Text Editor**: Users can input their story text and see it displayed in real-time.
- **AI Assistance**: The AI helps to continue the story from where the user leaves off, providing engaging characters, vivid descriptions, and coherent plot lines.
- **Editable AI Responses**: Users can edit the AI-generated responses to fine-tune the story as they see fit.
- **Formatting Toolbar**: A toolbar for basic text formatting (to be implemented).
- **Grammar and Punctuation Checks**: Shortcut commands for formatting and checking grammar and punctuation (to be implemented).
